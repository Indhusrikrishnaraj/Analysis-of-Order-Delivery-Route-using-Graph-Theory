# Analysis of Order Delivery Route using Graph Theory

This project builds a directed graph of cities and delivery routes using real-world-like distance data. It applies graph theory to analyze, visualize, and optimize delivery paths.

##  Features

- Builds directed graph from distance data (`distances.csv`)
- Visualizes the network with Matplotlib and PyVis
- Calculates:
  - Degree, in-degree, and out-degree centrality
  - Betweenness and closeness centrality
  - Louvain community detection
- Compares:
  - Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm vs. BFS for shortest path optimization

##  Key Analyses

- **Degree Analysis**: Identifies hubs with most delivery routes
- **Centrality Measures**: Determines critical cities in the network
- **Community Detection**: Reveals clusters of interconnected cities
- **Path Optimization**:
  - Dijkstraâ€™s shortest weighted path
  - BFS-based unweighted alternative
